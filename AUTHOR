        Parts (for jack) are based on the code of the sampler program called 'Specimen',
        and (for pulse-simple) on the code example 'parec-simple.c' on 'freedesktop.org'.
        For expansion using the standard pulse lib (so not pulse-simple),
        I suggest to look at the 'pavucontrol' source code as a guiding line.
