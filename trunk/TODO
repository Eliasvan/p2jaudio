TODO
----

In order of importance, the first one is the most important.

* Clean up unnecessary locks and mutexvariables. And clean up code.
* Use enumerations for 'bufferUnderrunSide' (or just 'side'), 'benchmarkStatus', 'state' and 'todo' variables.
* Write more documentation in the code and optionally function headers with preconditions.
* Bug testing.
* Improve performance. (1 low latency pipe (48000Hz) @ 1024periodSize uses in total 1% CPU on an Intel i5, and 3% @ 128periodSize)
* Create the ability to pass latency and bufferSize cmd arguments, so that no benchmark is required.
* Use pulse instead of pulse-simple to allow automatic creation of pipes and detection of NAME and NUM_CHANNELS.
  This delivers the advantage of less cpu-usage and memory-usage per pipe, and
  it can be used to synchronise pipes (to the maximum latency of all pipes).
  Then 'p2jaudio' may have to become a daemon.
* Implement './configure'.
* Implement 'make install'.
* Create header file.
* Optionally create the opposite of this program: so something like 'j2paudio'.
